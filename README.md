Android Application

This project was developed using Android Studio.

The application scans business cards: the user takes a picture, and the application then extracts and parses the text  from the said image. The user can then save the info to contacts, send email, etc.

The image-to-text is done using the Tess4j Library. Link here: http://tess4j.sourceforge.net/
(It was such a pain to get that set up!)
